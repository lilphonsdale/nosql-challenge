# Description

A dataset is imported from the commmand line with mongoimport. This dataset contains information about food establishments in the UK.

In the first notebook "NoSQL_setup_starter" MongoClient is used to talk to the data with python. A new item is added to the dataset and some of the data types are modified.

In the second notebook, "NoSQL_analysis_starter" MongoClient and pandas allow us to take a deeper dive into the data. We query based on different conditions, like location and hygiene rating. A pipeline query allows us to get very specific results across a number of criteria.
